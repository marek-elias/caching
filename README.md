This is the implementation of caching algorithms used to produce experimental results in the paper
Algorithms for Caching and MTS with reduced number of predictions by Abdel Sadek and Elias, accepted to ICLR 2024

it contains the implementation of the algorithm F&R from the same paper and implementation of the
algorithm AdaptiveQuery from paper Parsimonious learning-augmented caching by Im, Kumar, Petety, Purohit (ICML 2022).

They can be used together with the algorithms implemented in the paper
Online metric algorithms with untrusted predictions by Antoniadis, Coester, Elias, Polak, Simon (ICML 2020).
by adding them to the file algorithm.py in the repository
